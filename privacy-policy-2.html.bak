This Statement operates in conjunction with the Werner <a href="privacy-policy/index-2.htm#_top" data-anchor="#_top">Privacy Policy</a>. To the extent that this Statement and the Werner <a href="privacy-policy/index-2.htm#_top" data-anchor="#_top">Privacy Policy</a> are inconsistent, this Statement will govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information collected from Canadians.</p>
<p><strong>1</strong>. <strong>SCOPE</strong>.</p>

<p>For purposes of this Statement only, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<p>“Agent” means any party that collects or uses personal information under the instructions of, and solely for, Werner, or as to which Werner discloses personal information for use on Werner’s behalf.</p>
<p>“Werner” means Werner System Holdings, Inc.</p>
<p>“Personal information” means any personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include information that is anonymized.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong>. <strong>PRIVACY PRINCIPLES</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>CONSENT, COLLECTION AND USE</strong></p>

Werner will provide individuals with reasonable mechanisms to exercise these choices.</p>
<p>Werner will not collect, use or disclose your personal information without your informed consent, unless required or permitted to do so by law, or unless otherwise noted in this Statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Werner will only use and/or disclose personal information in accordance with the purpose for which it was collected, unless subsequently consented to, or when required or permitted by law.</p>
<p>If Werner receives personal information from &nbsp;&nbsp;Werner Affiliates or other entities in Canada, it will use and disclose such information in accordance with the consent received by such entities at the time of collection and the choices made by the individuals to whom such personal information relates.</p>
<p><strong>ONWARD TRANSFERS</strong></p>
<p>Werner will obtain assurances from its Agents and any third party to whom Werner discloses personal information that such Agent and/or third party will safeguard personal information consistently with this Statement. Werner will enter into a contract with such Agent and/or third party prior to affecting a transfer of personal information, which contract will provide at least the same level of protection as is required by this Statement and by applicable privacy legislation. Where Werner has knowledge that an Agent and/or third party is using or disclosing personal information in a manner contrary to this Statement, Werner will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure of the personal information and/or to obtain the Agent’s and/or third party’s deletion, destruction, anonymization or return of the personal information.</p>

Werner will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.

<p><strong>ACCESS</strong></p>
<p>Upon request, Werner will grant individuals reasonable access to personal information that it holds about them. In addition, Werner will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete. These requests can be made by contacting Werner as provided below.</p>
<p><strong>ENFORCEMENT</strong></p>
<p>Werner will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Statement. Werner will use contractual or other means to ensure that its Agents provide a comparable level of protection over your personal information while the information is being processed by such parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only employees whose duties require access to personal information are granted such access, and only to the extent necessary.
