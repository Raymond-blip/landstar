<section class="generalContent rte">
    <p>Welcome to our site (the “Site”). The Site is operated by Werner System Holdings, Inc. (“Werner”, “we” or” “us”) on its own behalf or on behalf of Werner Affiliates. This document (the “Terms of Use” or the “Agreement”) establishes the terms and conditions governing your use of the Site. A “Werner Affiliate(s)” is any entity that controls, is under common control with, or is controlled by, Werner.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use, together with Werner’s <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, constitute a binding agreement between users of the Site (“you”, unless otherwise specified) and Werner.</p>
<p>By using the Site, you acknowledge and signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Agreement. You must agree to this Agreement in order to access or use the Site.</p>
<p>This Agreement contains the following provisions:</p>
<p><strong>1</strong>. <strong>Your Acceptance of this Agreement</strong>.</p>
<p>This is an agreement between you and Werner and governs your use of the Site, its contents and services. Each time you visit, browse, order goods through, purchase goods through, advertise goods through, access or otherwise use the Site, you signify your acceptance and agreement, and the acceptance and agreement of any person you purport to represent (and for the purposes of this Agreement, “person” includes any type of incorporated or unincorporated entity, including your employer), without limitation or qualification, to be bound by this Agreement for using the Site, and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Please read the Terms of Use carefully before you start to use the Site. By using the Site (or by clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Use when this option is made available to you), you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Use. If you do not want to agree to these Terms of Use, you must not access or use the Site.</p>
<p>By accessing this Site, you represent and warrant that you are at least eighteen (18) years old and that you have the legal authority to agree to and accept this Agreement on behalf of yourself and any person you purport to represent. If you do not have the legal authority to agree to and accept this Agreement, or if you are not authorized to agree to and accept this Agreement, or if you do not agree with the terms of this Agreement, then you may not use the Site.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong>. <strong>Scope of this Agreement</strong>.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use only apply to your activities when using the Site or its contents. From time to time, we may establish or authorize a Werner service provider to establish a Werner-branded website that operates under different terms and conditions, such as the <a href="http://www.trmsites.com/werner/home.asp?siteid=90017" data-anchor="?siteid=90017">Werner Company Store</a> or the <a href="https://usr57.dayforcehcm.com/CandidatePortal/en-US/werner">Werner Candidate Portal</a>, each of which are operated and managed by a separate company under separate terms and conditions. Those different terms and conditions will be linked to that website’s home page. Please review such different terms and conditions if you choose to visit those websites, as they govern your use thereof.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use do not affect or amend the terms of any other contracts you have entered into or may enter into with Werner or a Werner Affiliate, such as carrier contracts, agency agreements, transportation and logistics contracts, and other contracts for Werner goods or services (each of these separate contracts with Werner and/or Werner Affiliates is referred to as a “Werner Contracts”), and your and Werner’s (and Werner Affiliates’) respective obligations thereunder, except as otherwise expressly set forth in such Werner Contract.  </p>
<p><strong>3</strong>. <strong>Authority</strong>.</p>
<p>The content and services for this Site are based in the state of Florida in the United States and provided for access and use only by persons located in the United States, Canada and Mexico. You acknowledge that you may not be able to access all or some of the Site outside of the United States, Canada and Mexico; and that access to the Site outside North America may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If you access the Site from outside the United States, you are responsible for compliance with local laws. Accessing the Site in Canada or Mexico may afford you additional privacy protections.

<p><strong>4</strong>. <strong>Changes to these Terms of Use</strong>.</p>
<p>We may modify, suspend or terminate the operation of the Site, as well as its content and offerings, in whole and/or in part, in our sole discretion, at any time and for any reason.</p>
<p>From time to time, Werner may, in its sole discretion, for any reason and without any liability to you or any other person, change, supplement or amend these Terms of Use, or require that you agree to additional terms and conditions (the “Revised Terms”) in order to continue using the Site. Access to some areas of the Site may be limited to users who have been authenticated and granted permission by Werner. Werner reserves its right to revoke permission to access such areas of the Site for any reason.</p>
<p>You may be required to agree to Revised Terms in order for you to obtain permission to access some areas of the Site, using access credentials consisting of a User ID (defined below) and Password (defined below), access certain areas of the Site or utilize certain features or functions offered on the Site by Werner. For example, certain portions of the Site may only be accessible to those who have met prerequisite Werner business qualifications or to those situated in particular geographic locations. Werner may require you to agree to Revised Terms before you are allowed to post information to the Site, participate in group discussions or business forums, enter sweepstakes and contests, engage in similar interactive activities or participate in commercial activities. Such Revised Terms are incorporated herein by reference and made a part of these Terms of Use.</p>
<p>These Terms of Use may only be modified in writing by an authorized officer of Werner and they may not be modified orally or in writing by our Site’s customer service representatives or our employees. You may not change, supplement, or amend these Terms of Use in any manner.</p>
<p>You are responsible for checking for revisions to the Terms of Use each time you use the Site and, in any event, are bound to changes to this Agreement thirty (30) days after such changes have been introduced.</p>
<p>Any changes to the dispute resolution procedures set forth below in Governing Law and Venue shall not apply to any disputes that have been commenced prior to the changes to the Terms of Use taking effect.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong>. <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>.</p>
